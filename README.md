# Project Truncus: Hello World Hackathon 2019
## Contributors: Mitchell Witt, Steven Bass, Alex Glass, Donovan Chiu

Project Truncus is a daily interactive Chrome extension that tracks the user's daily ecological footprint through our patent pending Ecoscore. The user logs in every day to input their ecological data and the extension tracks their progress to see if they have improved or worsened their ecological footprint. Project Truncus also adds an incentive to its users to lower their Ecoscore by giving them a tree to name and take care of daily; the higher the user's Ecoscore the more barren the tree will look, and the lower the user's score the healthier the tree will look. Our hope for this project is to help our users realize the importance of their resource consumption and take strides to lower their ecological footprint.
